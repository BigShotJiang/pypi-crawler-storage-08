Any or\n        all use of the Initial Software is subject to compliance with the terms\n        and conditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work\n        and no one shall be entitled to modify the terms and conditions for the\n        distribution of said Initial Software.\n        \n        The Holder undertakes that the Initial Software will remain ruled at\n        least by this Agreement, for the duration set forth in Article 4.2.\n        \n        \n              6.2 OVER THE CONTRIBUTIONS\n        \n        The Licensee who develops a Contribution is the owner of the\n        intellectual property rights over this Contribution as defined by\n        applicable law.\n        \n        \n              6.3 OVER THE EXTERNAL MODULES\n        \n        The Licensee who develops an External Module is the owner of the\n        intellectual property rights over this External Module as defined by\n        applicable law and is free to choose the type of agreement that shall\n        govern its distribution.\n        \n        \n              6.4 JOINT PROVISIONS\n        \n        The Licensee expressly undertakes:\n        \n           1. not to remove, or modify, in any manner, the intellectual property\n              notices attached to the Software;\n        \n           2. to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in the copies\n              of the Software modified or not.\n        \n        The Licensee undertakes not to directly or indirectly infringe the\n        intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors on the\n        Software and to take, where applicable, vis-Ã -vis its staff, any and all\n        measures required to ensure respect of said intellectual property rights\n        of the Holder and/or Contributors.\n        \n        \n            Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES\n        \n        7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to\n        provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.\n        \n        However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The\n        terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such\n        maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the\n        Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services\n        shall incur liability therefor.\n        \n        7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under\n        its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon\n        itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified\n        Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said\n        warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,\n        shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor\n        and the Licensee.\n        \n        \n            Article 8 - LIABILITY\n        \n        8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be\n        entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered\n        from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant\n        Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.\n        \n        8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under\n        this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:\n        (i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its\n        obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the\n        Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more\n        generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly\n        agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,\n        loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,\n        opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all\n        legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,\n        shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to\n        any or all compensation from the Licensor.\n        \n        \n            Article 9 - WARRANTY\n        \n        9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical\n        state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all\n        possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of\n        possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's\n        attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,\n        modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are\n        reserved for experienced users.\n        \n        The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,\n        the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working\n        order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons\n        or properties.\n        \n        9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled\n        to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the\n        rights set forth in Article 5).\n        \n        9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied \"as is\" by\n        the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than\n        that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty \n        as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant \n        nature.\n        \n        Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free\n        from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will\n        be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software\n        configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.\n        \n        9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the\n        Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right\n        relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,\n        the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee\n        arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be\n        instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the\n        Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against\n        the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal\n        assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be\n        decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the\n        Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor\n        disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the\n        name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of\n        prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence\n        of a trademark.\n        \n        \n            Article 10 - TERMINATION\n        \n        10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations\n        hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement\n        thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has\n        remained ineffective.\n        \n        10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be\n        authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software.
