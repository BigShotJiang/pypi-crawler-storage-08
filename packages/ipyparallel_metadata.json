Each contributor maintains copyright\n        over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these\n        contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython\n        source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or\n        institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython\n        Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what\n        changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate\n        their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the\n        change to one of the IPython repositories.\n        \n        With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file\n        to indicate the copyright and license terms:\n        \n            # Copyright (c) IPython Development Team.\n            # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.",
