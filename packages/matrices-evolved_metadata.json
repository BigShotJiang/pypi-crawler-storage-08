Definitions\n         “Licensor” means Albert Blasczykowski, doing business as Aless Microsystems, and any authorized successors or assigns.\n         “Licensee” means the individual or legal entity exercising rights under this License.\n         “Licensed Work” means the software, algorithms, models, documentation, and associated materials distributed by the Licensor under this License, including any updates or supplements.\n         “Modification” means any work based on or incorporating the Licensed Work, including derivative works, adaptations, translations, or integrations, whether in source or object form.\n         “Non‑Commercial Use” means use that is not intended for, directed toward, or in connection with generating revenue or other commercial advantage, and is limited to personal, hobbyist, educational, academic, research, or internal testing/evaluation by non‑profit institutions and individual researchers.\n         “Prohibited Parties” means: (a) any military, intelligence, defense, or government organization; (b) any person or entity acting for, on behalf of, funded by, contracting for, or in material collaboration with such organizations; (c) defense contractors and subcontractors at any tier; and (d) any party on an applicable sanctions or export‑control list.\n         “Prohibited Purposes” means any military, intelligence, defense, or governmental application, including but not limited to weapons design or operation, command‑and‑control, targeting, surveillance or reconnaissance outside lawful civilian law‑enforcement norms, signals or human intelligence collection/analysis, cyber offense, battlefield logistics, training, simulation, or testing in support of any of the foregoing.\n         2. License Grant\n         Subject to full and continuous compliance with this License, the Licensor grants the Licensee a personal, worldwide, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable, revocable license to:\n         (a) access and use the Licensed Work solely for Non‑Commercial Use;\n         (b) reproduce the Licensed Work for Non‑Commercial Use;\n         (c) create, use, and reproduce Modifications for Non‑Commercial Use; and\n         (d) distribute the Licensed Work and Modifications for Non‑Commercial Use only, strictly under the terms of this same License.\n         No rights are granted by implication or estoppel, and all rights not expressly granted are reserved.\n         3. Field‑of‑Use and User Restrictions\n         No Commercial Use: Use by for‑profit entities or for revenue‑generating, production, operational, or service‑providing purposes (including SaaS, internal business operations, consulting deliverables, or advertising‑supported offerings) is prohibited.\n         No Government Use: Use by or for any national, federal, state, provincial, municipal, supranational, or intergovernmental body or agency, or any government‑controlled entity, is strictly prohibited, whether direct or through intermediaries.\n         No Military/Intelligence Use: Use by or for any Prohibited Parties or for any Prohibited Purposes is strictly prohibited.\n         No Indirect Facilitation: The Licensed Work and any Modifications must not be used to enable, assist, train, fine‑tune, integrate, evaluate, or otherwise support any activity by Prohibited Parties or for Prohibited Purposes, whether directly or indirectly, including through intermediaries, contractors, agents, affiliates, resellers, or downstream recipients.\n         4. Redistribution and Pass‑Through\n         Any redistribution of the Licensed Work or Modifications must be solely for Non‑Commercial Use and must include a complete, verbatim copy of this License, copyright notices, and any attribution notices provided by the Licensor.\n         The Licensee must not impose additional terms that conflict with or dilute the restrictions herein, and must not sublicense under different terms.\n         Any downstream recipient automatically becomes a “Licensee” under this License and must accept it prior to use or receipt.\n         5. Source Availability and Network Use\n         If the Licensed Work or Modifications are made available to third parties in object code or are used to provide functionality over a network to third parties (including via web services, APIs, or hosted interfaces), the complete corresponding source code for the provided functionality must be made available to those third parties at no charge under this same License.\n         “Corresponding source” means all source files and build scripts necessary to generate, install, and run the distributed or network‑accessible components, excluding general‑purpose tools and unmodified third‑party dependencies distributed under their own licenses.\n         6. Attribution, Notices, and NOTICE File\n         Copyright and license notices provided by the Licensor must be preserved in source distributions and, where technically feasible, in user‑visible notices for object/hosted deployments.\n         If a NOTICE file is provided, all redistributions in object or hosted form must include a readable copy of the NOTICE file with attribution text unmodified except for formatting.\n         \n         6A. Non‑Affiliation, No‑Endorsement, and Trademarks\n         The Licensor is a private party and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or acting on behalf of any government, ministry, agency, military, intelligence, defense organization, or government‑controlled entity, and no Licensee may state or imply any sponsorship, approval, affiliation, or endorsement by the Licensor or any government.\n         No license to any trademark, trade name, or service mark of the Licensor is granted under this License, and such marks must not be used to endorse or promote derivative projects or services without prior written permission.\n         \n         7. Third‑Party Software\n         The Licensed Work may include or interface with third‑party components that are licensed under their own terms, which govern such components, and nothing in this License grants rights to third‑party intellectual property.\n         8. Support, Issues, and Verification\n         Any voluntary support, issue triage, or feature requests (if offered) are available exclusively through the Licensor’s designated public issue tracker for this project; currently, the Support Channel is only the project’s GitHub Issues page at https://github.com/alessblaze/Matrices-Evolved/issues.\n         Issue submitters must provide their full legal name; anonymous or pseudonymous requests may be declined.\n         Requests submitted by or on behalf of Prohibited Parties, or attempts to route support through intermediaries, agents, or alternative channels, may be refused at the Licensor’s discretion.\n         Support is discretionary and not a contractual obligation.\n         9. Compliance Assurance\n         On reasonable written request, the Licensee must provide a short, good‑faith written attestation describing Non‑Commercial Use and confirming that neither the Licensee nor known downstream recipients are Prohibited Parties and that the Licensed Work is not used for Prohibited Purposes or government use.\n         The Licensor may decline or terminate distribution, updates, keys, or access to new versions upon credible evidence of non‑compliance.\n         10. Term and Termination\n         This License is effective upon first access to or use of the Licensed Work and continues unless terminated.\n         All rights under this License terminate automatically and without notice if any term is breached, including but not limited to any Commercial Use, any government use, use by or for Prohibited Parties, or use for Prohibited Purposes.\n         Upon termination, all use must cease, and all copies (including Modifications) must be destroyed or permanently deleted; sections that by their nature should survive (including 3–7 and 9–15) shall survive.\n         Any reinstatement is solely at the Licensor’s written discretion.\n         11. No Warranty\n         THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY.\n         12. Limitation of Liability\n         TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR THE LICENSED WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n         13. Export Controls and Sanctions (India)\n         The Licensed Work may be subject to India’s export‑control and sanctions laws, including the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992, DGFT’s SCOMET List under the Foreign Trade Policy, and the Weapons of Mass Destruction and their Delivery Systems (Prohibition of Unlawful Activities) Act, 2005, as amended.\n         Licensees must not export, re‑export, transfer, or provide access to the Licensed Work, including intangible transfers such as downloads, cloud/API access, remote collaboration, or hosted interfaces for foreign persons, unless compliant with applicable licensing or authorization requirements, screening obligations, and prohibitions.\n         Licensees shall screen end users and destinations, refrain from dealings with sanctioned parties, and not export or divert the Licensed Work for WMD‑related end uses or users.\n         14. Privacy and Data\n         The Licensed Work is not designed to process regulated personal data unless expressly stated by the Licensor; the Licensee is solely responsible for compliance with applicable data‑protection laws in any deployment.\n         15. Injunctive Relief\n         Breach of Sections 3–6A constitutes irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be inadequate; the Licensor is entitled to seek immediate injunctive or equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.\n         16. Governing Law and Forum\n         This License is governed by the laws of India, without regard to conflicts of law principles, and courts located in India shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over all disputes arising out of or relating to this License.\n         17. Severability; No Waiver\n         If any provision is held unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable, and the remainder shall continue in effect, and failure to enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver.\n         18. Assignment\n         The Licensee may not assign, delegate, or transfer this License, by operation of law or otherwise, without the Licensor’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment is void.\n         19. Entire Agreement; Changes\n         This License is the entire agreement concerning the Licensed Work and supersedes all prior understandings related to its subject matter, and the Licensor may publish updated versions for new releases; existing releases remain under the version accompanying that release unless the Licensor permits re‑licensing.\n         20. Compliance with Laws\n         Use of the Licensed Work must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to dual‑use technologies and end‑use restrictions.\n         21. Source Identification (SPDX)\n         To facilitate compliance tooling and SBOMs, redistributed sources should include an SPDX header identifying this License using a custom SPDX identifier, for example: “SPDX‑License‑Identifier: LicenseRef‑Aless‑SA‑NC‑NM‑NG‑1.0”.\n         \n         By accessing, using, modifying, or distributing the Licensed Work, the Licensee accepts this License and confirms understanding of the non‑commercial scope, no‑government/no‑military restrictions, and redistribution/source‑availability obligations.\n         ",
